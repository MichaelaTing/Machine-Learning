# Machine-Learning

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Over the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, efficient web searches, and deep insights into the human genome. Machine learning is so ubiquitous these days that you probably use it dozens of times every day without even realizing it. Many researchers also believe this is the best path toward human-level artificial intelligence. 

In this course, you will learn the most effective machine learning techniques and master them in practice to make them work for you. What's more, you'll not only learn the theoretical foundations of learning, but you'll also gain the practical skills needed to apply these techniques to new problems quickly and powerfully. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best innovation practices in machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include 
- Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
- Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovative processes in machine learning and artificial intelligence). 

The course will also draw on a large number of case studies and applications, allowing you to understand how to apply learning algorithms to intelligent robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, etc. field.
